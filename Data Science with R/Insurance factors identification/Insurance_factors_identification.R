#the dimensions of the dataset are 2182 x 7 
#through summary we can see that the mean of kilometre is 2.986 ie, 10,000-15,000
#similarly the maximum number of claims are 3338 and mean is 51.97 
##we perform corelation to find out the relation between Claims and Payment
b=cor(insur$Claims,insur$Payment)
b*100 #percentage of corelation between claims and payments
#hence we can see that the corelation between claims and payment are 0.9954 ie, 99% corelated ,

c=cor(insur$Claims,insur$Insured)

#claims and insured have corelation of 91% 
d=cor(insur$Insured,insur$Payment)
d*100
##Payment and Insured has Corelation of 93% 
plot(insur$Claims,insur$Insured)
plot(insur$Payment,insur$Insured)
##we can see that the plot between claims and payment was linear
##we now use linear regression for Payments vs the rest of the data

##in these 5 zones we could see 1st km dist has been more insured than others with 2nd being close to it
##the amount of claims in the 2nd km distribution is higher hence more payments

##here we can see that variations are low with 7th group having more insured count
