<p>The remaining columns depict the sales for each dress on a particular date.<br>
Date ranges from 29/8/2013 to 12/10/2013, and the sales are registered for alternative days.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis Tasks:</strong><br>
The goals of this project are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To automate the process of recommendations, the store needs to analyze the given attributes of the product, like the style, season, etc., and come up with a model to predict the recommendation of products (in binary output – 0 or 1) accordingly.</li>
	<li>In order to stock the inventory, the store wants to analyze the sales data and predict the trend of total sales for each dress for an extended period of three more alternative days.</li>
	<li>To decide the pricing for various upcoming clothes, they wish to find how the style, season, and material affect the sales of a dress and if the style of the dress is more influential than its price.</li>
	<li>Also, to increase sales, the management wants to analyze the attributes of dresses and find which are the leading factors affecting the sale of a dress.</li>
	<li>To regularize the rating procedure and find its efficiency, the store wants to find if the rating of the dress affects the total sales</li>
</ul>
